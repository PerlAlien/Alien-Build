In this directory are some example L<alienfile>s.  You can test them with
the L<af> command if you have L<App::af> installed.  For example:

 % af install --prefix=/tmp/foo -f xz.alienfile

If you want to force a C<share> install you can use the C<--type> 
option:

 % af install --type=share --prefix=/tmp/foo -f xz.alienfile

For more details on what you can do with the L<af> command, please see 
its documentation.
