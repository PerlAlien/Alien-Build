# ABSTRACT: Temp Dir support for Alien::Build
# VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is private to L<Alien::Build>.

=cut

# problem with vanilla File::Temp is that is often uses
# as /tmp that has noexec turned on.  Workaround is to
# create a temp directory in the build directory, but
# we have to be careful about cleanup.  This puts all that
# (attempted) carefulness in one place so that when we
# later discover it isn't so careful we can fix it in
# one place rather thabn alllll the places that we need
# temp directories.

# we also have a speical case for Windows, which often
# has problems with long paths if we try to use the
# current directory for temp files, so for those we
# use the system tmp directory.
